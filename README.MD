# Team Profile Generator

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
<br />

This is a team profile generator. It is a Node.js CLI app that uses Inquirer to query the user for information regarding a software engineering team, and generates a simple team profile HTML page with summaries for each team member, built using Bootstrap. The aim of this project was to demonstrate my understanding of test-driven development.
